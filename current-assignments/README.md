# Assignments

<!-- ##### üëæ Coding Exercise 1 (Foundation)

*Due this Wednesday, January 27:*

- Do this assignment first (strongly recommended)
-  We will spend 50% of our time in this course coding. Having a shared foundation for this is **extremely important**. I will always be there to support and assist you with problems you encounter. For now, please work your way through üëæ [Coding Exercise 1 ~ Foundation](../coding-exercises/exercise1-foundation) and submit your work in the end.
- Here is a thorough, interactive ``basic-javascript`` tutorial if you want to brush up your skills: [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/). And [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) is Codecadey's version. -->






<!-- ##### üñç Dear Data: Reading Visualizations

*Due Monday, February 1:*

- Dear Data is a project and book by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec. We can learn a lot from them about visualizing data. This assignment is explained in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PTTTbewj2zsqgztBhNZKB2ipunpI7jiok2tmm_kfhXE/edit?usp=sharing). Make sure to first read the introduction, then claim and study two visualizations. Be prepared to explain them in the next class. -->




##### üëæ Coding Exercise 2 (Form Data, plain JS)

*Due Wednesday, February 3:*

- Create a Google Form collecting data of the "linear scale" type (like we did in this week's Lab)
- collect responses from at least 10 people (e.g. send it to people in this class (use Slack), or open the form on your phone and walk around the cafeteria!)
- use the techniques used in [the lab](../labs/lab1/) to
- export the data in `json` format
- transform it to an array with average values
- build a bar graph using JavaScript
  - be creative and make it look more fun than my example!
- the last two points can be worked on simultaneously (you don't need all the responses to start working on the code)
- [how to collect and use data with Google Forms](../labs/collect-data-google-form)
- When you are done, post links to Code and the Live Website to the [Class Wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2021/wiki).


##### üëÅ Watch this talk by Mike Bostock, Eyeo 2013

##### üìñ Reading 1 (Data Intro)

*Due Sunday(!), February 7, at noon:*

- Find this Reading Assignment [here](../readings/reading1).


##### üí° Data Zine Subject Proposal

*Due Monday, February 8:*

- Take a good amount of time ideating about your subject for the [Data Zine Project](../projects/data-zine). This [excerpt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZXBsuQcTlQbHrta8ePUnHe8rPAmZAerx) from Dear Data might help to envision this process.
- In the next class, be prepared to introduce your subject.
- Remember that ultimately, your dataset should have at least 20 individual data points, each with at least four features.
- The phenomenon you pick must be something that occurs over time.
- It is highly recommended to consider a phenomenon that has nothing to do with technology and that you find poetic.
