#### Assignment
"[Automating Inequality](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250074317)" (2018) is a fantastic book by Virginia Eubanks that addresses specifically who is impacted by the process of datafication of society. The "who" that is the subject of this book are not individuals, but groups of people.
For thus reading (listening/watching) assignment listen to an interview with the author Virginia Eubanks, and the additional material listed above.

Takes notes formulate short responses (250-400 words); the following prompts may help you.


Prompts:
>How to technical tools promise to *fair out* the remaining discrimination that exist in social/welfare systems? In how far can they succeed, in which ways do they fail?

>Imagine, what could this (following quote) mean in the widest sense?
"*The state doesn't need a cop to kill a person" and "electronic incarceration*"

>What do you understand this to mean?
"*systems act as a kind of 'empathy-overwrite'*"

>China is much more advanced and expansive when it comes to applying technical solutions to societal processes or instant challenges ([recent example](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html?)). Try to point example cases in China that are in accordance or in opposition to the problematics discussed in the podcast. Perhaps you can think of
"*technical systems not well thought-through about what their impact on human beings is*"
